    description: |
      You stand before the imposing stone entrance to the Crypt of Sorrows.
      The air is cold and a sense of dread hangs heavy. Your tattered map,
      found in your grandfather's attic, marks this as the spot.
      A large, iron-banded wooden door bars your way. It is slightly ajar.
    choices:
      - text: "Push the door and enter the crypt."
        next_scene_id: "entry_hall"
      - text: "Check your map one more time."

  check_map:
    description: |
      You pull out the tattered map. The ink is faded, but you can make out a small,
      hastily scrawled note near the crypt's entrance marker: *'The key is in the shadow of the gargoyle.'*
      You look up and see two stone gargoyles flanking the entrance.
    choices:
      - text: "Search the left gargoyle."

        next_scene_id: "entry_hall"

  search_gargoyle:
    description: |
      You search the base of the gargoyle and your fingers brush against a loose stone.
      Prying it open, you find a small, rusty iron key. This could be useful.

      - text: "Take the key and enter the crypt."
        next_scene_id: "entry_hall"
        effects:
          - add_item: "rusty key"

  entry_hall:
    description: |
      The main hall is vast and silent. Dust motes dance in a single shaft of light
      from a crack in the ceiling. Two passages lead deeper into the darkness.
      In the center of the room is a stone chest with a rusty lock.
    choices:
      - text: "Take the left passage."
        next_scene_id: "left_passage"
      - text: "Take the right passage."

          - lacks_item: "rusty key"

  open_chest:
    description: |
      The rusty key fits perfectly into the lock. With a loud *CLICK*, the chest opens.
      Inside you find a glowing health potion and 50 gold pieces.

  smash_chest:
    description: "You try to smash the lock with your bare hands, but it's futile. You just end up with bruised knuckles."
